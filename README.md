      - When user clicks in the "this" button, the number following will be incremented.

 3. As a following line, there is a block containing a textbox and a line "You said:" below.
    - When user types any characters or numbers in the textbox, the following line will immediately show out that string of characters or numbers.

  4. Finally, the final block appeared in grey color in the beginning including a line "The click counter is not greater than 4" in the center adjustment.
      - When user clicks the "this" button from 1 to 3 times, this grey block would not change. It will only change to the yellow color if user clicks more than 3 times in that "this" button.
